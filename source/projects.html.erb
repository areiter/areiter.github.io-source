  <h3>A web-based point-of-sale system</h3>
  <p>Orderjames is not a standalone point-of-sale system, but acts as an extension of the products from <a href="https://www.finanzkasse.at">Finanzkasse</a>.
  From a technical point-of-view, it is a web-based system and can be started from the mobile browser. Dock it to the home screen to remove the address bar and get a custom app-feeling.
    Orderjames is realized as a single-page-application hence does all the loading upfront, and does not suffer from reduced performance as many other systems do.
  </p>
    <p>To also directly support devices like mobile printers or mobile credit card terminals, we also provide an app which encapsulates Orderjames and injects native capabilities into the web application</p>
    <p>This is an ongoing project and is actively development.</p>

    <h3>Point-of-sale system</h3>
    <p>At <a href="https://www.finanzkasse.at">finanzkasse.at</a> we offer a complete point-of-sale system, primarily for the Austrian market</p>
    <p>The system contains of several components with a clear separation of responsibilities: Configuration application as a central point to add all the configuration and data, Query to perform statistical analysis, Terminal to take orders.
      The whole system is following a client-server approach, of course offering multi-terminal support.</p>

    <p>A central point of point-of-sale system, especially when targeting the hospitality industry (e.g. restaurants, bars,...), is to connect to supporting devices like coffee machines
    dispension units, credit card terminals, waiter locks, barcode scanners, various printers and so on.
    Futhermore we integrated (besides our own Orderjames solution) other commonly used mobile terminals.</p>

    <p>This also is an ongoing project and is extended and improved continuously.</p>

  <h3>EBilly - validate your receipts</h3>
  <p>A new Austrian regulation in 2016 obliged all shops in Austria to digitally sign their receipts.
  The signature is, in most cases, encoded as QRCode and printed on the receipt. Customers have no way of verifying the signature.
  EBilly uses publicly available data from the registered certificate authorities and company registers to cryptographically verify the receipt data,
    and collects the company information.

    <h3>Library to comunicate with credit card terminals</h3>
    <p>Libecterm is a .net library implementing the ZVT protocol to communicate with credit card terminals.
      The ZVT protocol is used by major payment companies in Europe for the comunication of credit-card terminals with point-of-sale systems.</p>
    <p>The commercial version of this library has extended command support and also includes support for other terminals not supporting the ZVT protocol</p>
